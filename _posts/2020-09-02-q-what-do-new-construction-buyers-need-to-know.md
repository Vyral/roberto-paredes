<center><em>Here are five things to think about before buying a new construction home.</em></center>

&nbsp;

Those who are looking to purchase resale homes may or may not realize that, for nearly the same price, new construction could also be a viable option. However, there are five things that you need to consider before proceeding with a new construction purchase.

**Feel free to follow our discussion in the video above, or else use the timestamps below to navigate the topic at your leisure:**

0:23—No. 1: Who represents you? The importance of finding good agent representation

2:37—No. 2: Base price versus actual price, and the dangers of false expectations

5:35—No. 3: Closing costs for new construction are typically higher than resale closing costs

7:50—No. 4: What incentives does the builder provide to the buyer?

9:40—No. 5: Navigating the complexities of the new construction process

11:49—Things to check up on before the end of the building process

As a professional agent, I highly recommend that you consider these five points before undergoing a purchase. New construction is great—you can build a beautiful home that you couldn’t find in the market, and there are so many great builders out there to work with. But ultimately, buying new construction is a different process from buying resale and you need to be aware of it.
