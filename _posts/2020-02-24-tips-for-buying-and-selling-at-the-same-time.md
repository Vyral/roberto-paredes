A few years ago, I sat down with a great family who had outgrown their home. They wanted to buy another property in another part of town, but they also needed to sell their current home. **Here’s how we went about helping them.**

We sat down with them and asked about what they were looking for in a home. Once we figured that out, we started getting a plan together for their sale to make sure what they netted on the sale would be enough for them to purchase their new home.

We got the home ready for sale, we put it on the market, then we went out and started looking at homes until we found their top three. **Once we were able to get a contract on their current home, we made a contingent offer on the home they wanted to buy.&nbsp;**

One of the most important things to consider is that there are a lot of moving parts in a situation like this. That’s why it’s critical that everybody is on the same page and communicating effectively. Any wrong move will affect the whole transaction. You need to work with a seasoned agent who can make this happen.&nbsp;

**All parties must agree on the same closing date so that you aren't left homeless or searching for temporary housing.** We always make sure we service our clients by negotiating a post-occupancy agreement in a situation like this. This will allow you to transition into your new home without becoming homeless.

These are just a few things we do to make sure our transactions are handled as smoothly as possible. If you have any other questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
